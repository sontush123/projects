# **Data Science projects in Python**
This repository contains data science and machine learning projects completed by me for learning and demonstration purposes.
- [Music_Generation_Using_Deep_Learning](https://github.com/sontush123/projects/tree/main/Music_Generation_Using_Deep_Learning) :In this project, I Genetated single instumental music using python and deeplearning keras RNN model. Here model understand the sequence of input pattern and then outputs the sequence of pattern as per probabilistacally used LSTM with many to many RNN model to perform operation.
 


- [Quora_Question_pair_similarity](https://github.com/sontush123/projects/tree/main/Quora_Question_pair_similarity) : In this project creat a model which identify the question asked on quora are duplicates of qustions are already avalable or not. I have derive some basic features and some advance features for minimizing error .uses various ML model to check the error and measure the accuracy matrix and uses loss funcion logloss to find accuracy.
